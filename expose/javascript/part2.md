1. print 3, because i endup at 3 after the loop
2. print 150, because the last number to do the discount is 300
3. print 150, because the last number to do the discount is 300
4. It will return an array having the discounted values, because discounted was set to be an empty array, and inside the loop values after discount is add to it.
5. error, i is not defined because let i can only be used inside the loop.
6. error, discountedPrice is not defined because let can only be used inside the loop.
7. 150, finalPrice is in the same block as the console.log so it can still be reached
8. It will return an array having the discounted values, because discounted was set to be an empty array, and inside the loop values after discount is add to it.
9. error, i is not defined because let i can only be used inside the loop.
10. 3, length of the prices array is 3
11. It will return an array having the discounted values, because discounted was set to be an empty array, and inside the loop values after discount is add to it.(modification to the array is fine for const, but not assigning another array to it).
12. A. student.name
    B. student["Grad Year"]
    C. student.greeting
    D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A.32 because integer maps to their exact string representation
    B.1, string maps to int
    C.3, null maps to 0
    D.3null, null maps to string
    E.4, true maps to 1
    F.0, false and null both maps to 0
    G.3undefined, undefined maps to string
    H.NaN, undefined maps to int which is NaN and any operation with NaN results in NaN
14. A.true, '2' maps to int 2 therefore its true
    B.false, comparision in string would be in alphabetical order
    C.true, '2' maps to int 2 therefore its true
    D.false, === means no value maps and they are different, one is in and one is string
    E.false, true would maps to 1, which is not equal to 2
    F.true, boolean(2) is true because any non-zero number converts to true.
15. == would do conversion before comparing, === would not do any conversions
17. first calling modifyArray with the first parameter array[1,2,3], and second parameter function doSomething. Inside the function newArr is empty, the for loop loops through the array, the value would go through doSomething function, and be stored to newArr. Therefore the result would be [2,4,6].
19. 1 4 3 2 is the output
